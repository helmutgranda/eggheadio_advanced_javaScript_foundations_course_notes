# 02. Working with Primitive Types

You may have heard that in JavaScript everything is an **Object** but this is not true, there are **seven** current types that are not **Objects**.

What makes a **Primative** type different?

* They can not be mutated
  * You cant mutate it like you would do an ```array``` or an ```object```
* Does not have a property or methods on it because it is not an **Object**
  
 **Operator** ```typeof``` evaluates a statement to its right, to determine what its type is.
 
 ```javascript
  console.log(typeof 'hello world') // string
  console.log(typeof 1) // number
  console.log(typeof false) // boolean
  console.log(typeof 42n) // bigint
  console.log(typeof Symbol()) // symbol
  console.log(typeof null) // object
  console.log(typeof undefined) // undefined
 ```
 
 **Primitive** types are treated different than Objects.
 
 ```javascript
 let obj = { a : 1 }
 
 function addTwo ( obj ) {
  obj.a = 2;
 }
 
 addTwo(obj)
 
 console.log(obj) // { a : 2}
 ```
 In the example above the variable is passed by its as memory reference (the obj in line 4 is the same variable as in line 1)
 
 This changes when we use **Primitive** types, for example: 
 
  ```javascript
 let num = 1
 
 function addTwo (num) {
  num = num + 2
  console.log(num) // 3
 }
 
 addTwo(num)
 
 console.log(num) // 1
 ```
 
 In this case the second console.log displays 1 because **Primitive** types are passed by value to function params, **Objects** are passed by memory reference. Also, please note that inside the function ```addTwo``` a new variable is being created.
 
 Even if we change the Primative Type like a String we will get the same result. See below:
 
   ```javascript
 let num = 'str'
 
 function addTwo (num) {
  num = num + num
  console.log(num) // strstr
 }
 
 addTwo(num)
 
 console.log(num) // str
 ```
 
 It passes it's value to the function and not its memory reference
