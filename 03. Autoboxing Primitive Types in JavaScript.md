# 03. Autoboxing Primitive Types in JavaScript

We often hear *everything* in JavaScript is an **Object** however there are **Primative** types that are not **Objects**.

```javascript
const str = 'fo'
console.log(typeof str) // string
console.log(str.length) // 3 - expected error / autoboxing
```

You would expect to see an error in the example above but JavaScript does what is called **Autoboxing**. It happens automatically when we treat an **Primative** type like an **Object**.

JavaScript will wrap the Primitives into an Object and with the *new* object it will connect it with the built-in object which gives us access to the .prototype methods from the browser.

This confirms that **Primitive** types are not objects but with **Autoboxing** we are able to use them as **Objects**.

```javascript
const str = 'foo'
console.log(typeof str) // string
console.log(str.length) //3 - autoboxing
console.log((10).toString()) //10 - autoboxing
console.log(true.valueOf()) //true - autoboxing
