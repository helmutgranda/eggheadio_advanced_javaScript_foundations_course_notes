# 01. Intro to Advanced JavaScript Foundations

The introduction video opens up with the author mentioning how being self-thought drove him to see some of the concepts that we are going to cover as foreign or a mistery.

Some of the concepts that will be cover are

* usage of ```this``` keyword
* using ```this``` implicitly
* using ```this``` explicitly
* power of coercion
* types - primitives
* autoboxing - Why are we able to treat non-primitives?
* prototype chain
* ```new``` keyword
* Difference between a function .prototype and ._proto_ property that live in all object types
* What really is inheritance within JavaScript
* Why do we always have access to methos in array instances like ```map``` ```filter``` and ```reduce```
* Scoping concepts
* Block scope
* ```let```
* ```const```
* ```var```

These concepts are not required in to use React or Angular but understanding them can make a difference in your career.
